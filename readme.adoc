= Apellicon

Apellicon is named after a famous greek book collector from 1st Century BC.

Apellicon is an API registry and search engine. It provides a basic search UI for API discovery and an api for uploading API specifications.

* OpenAPI 2/3 JSON and YAML formats
* WADL XML interface definitions

== In a hurry

If you have docker installed just run:

    docker build --tag apellicon -f docker/Dockerfile .

    docker-compose docker/docker-componse start

This will build apillicon:latest, download an elastic search container and if everything works as planned you can open the app in your browser:

    http://localhost:8000

== Adding data

    sh scripts/upload.sh
